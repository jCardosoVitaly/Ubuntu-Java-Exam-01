/**
 * Exercise 10: Multithreading
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE: Understand concurrent programming with threads
 * 
 * DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. CREATING THREADS:
 *    Create a thread, implement Runnable interface
 * 
 * 2. THREAD METHODS:
 *    - start(): Begin thread execution
 *    - sleep(ms): Pause thread for milliseconds
 *    - join(): Wait for thread to finish
 *
 * 3. DEMONSTRATION:
 *    - Using Runnable, show by console the examples created
 *
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
 * === BASIC THREADING ===
 * Thread-1: Count 1
 * Thread-2: Count 1
 * Thread-1: Count 2
 * Thread-2: Count 2
 * Thread-1: Count 3
 * Thread-2: Count 3
