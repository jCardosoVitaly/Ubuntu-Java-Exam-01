# 🎓 Java Practical Exam

## Ubuntu Project - Java 2025

A practical Java exam covering essential concepts from OOP to multithreading.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Exam

```powershell
cd demo
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

## 📝 Exercises

### Exercise 1: 4 Pillars of OOP
Demonstrate **Encapsulation** and **Abstraction** with a vehicle system (Vehicle → Car).

---

### Exercise 2: JVM, JRE, and JDK
Explain briefly what JVM, JRE, and JDK are and how Java code executes.

---

### Exercise 3: Primitive vs Reference Types
Show the difference between primitive types (stored in Stack) and reference types (stored in Heap).

---

### Exercise 4: Methods and Constructors Overloading
Create a Product class with **constructor overloading** (3 different constructors).

---

### Exercise 5: Memory Management
Implement **method overloading** using the Product class with different add() methods.

---

### Exercise 6: Abstract Classes and Enums
Create examples of:
- Abstract class (Payment system)
- Enum (PaymentStatus with methods)

---

### Exercise 7: Lambda Expressions
Use lambda expressions with a functional interface (StringProcessor) to:
- Convert text to uppercase
- Reverse strings

---

### Exercise 8: Collections Framework
Use ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and Streams API to manage and process data.

---

### Exercise 9: Exception Handling
Demonstrate try-catch-finally and create a custom exception class.

---

### Exercise 10: Multithreading
Create threads using Runnable and demonstrate synchronization with a shared counter.
